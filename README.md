# power-bi-project

This project is for putting my Power BI skills to work. 
I worked with data from Maven Market, a multi-national grocery chain with locations in Canada, Mexico, and the United States. 
In this project, I worked through the entire business intelligence workflow, including: 
  1. Connecting and shaping the data
  2. Building a relational model
  3. Adding calculated fields with Data Analysis Expressions (DAX)
  4. Designing an interactive dashboard
