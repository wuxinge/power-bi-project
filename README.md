# power-bi-project

This project is initiated from a course on Udemy named [_Microsoft Power BI Desktop for Business Intelligence (2023)_](https://www.udemy.com/course/microsoft-power-bi-up-running-with-power-bi-desktop/). I decided to work on this project because I want to get my hands dirty and put my Power BI skills to work. 
The dataset is from Maven Market, a multi-national grocery chain with locations in Canada, Mexico, and the United States. 

<br>In this project, I worked through the entire business intelligence workflow, including: 
  1. [Connecting and shaping the data](https://github.com/wuxinge/power-bi-project/tree/7951ba8b08ebd53cc6110cbf56d89e5a60e0a86c/Connecting%20and%20shaping%20the%20data)
  2. [Building a relational model](https://github.com/wuxinge/power-bi-project/tree/3312585d679360ff367ee70b9345d3acbd5bb9fa/Building%20the%20data%20model)
  3. [Adding calculated fields with Data Analysis Expressions (DAX)](https://github.com/wuxinge/power-bi-project/blob/d04a04d08d81a376d697361c8baf843b89fc63af/Adding%20DAX%20Measures/README.md)
  4. [Designing an interactive dashboard]()
