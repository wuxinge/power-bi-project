# power-bi-project

This project is for putting my Power BI skills to work. 
I worked with data from Maven Market, a multi-national grocery chain with locations in Canada, Mexico, and the United States. 
In this project, I worked through the entire business intelligence workflow, including: 
  1. [Connecting and shaping the data](https://github.com/wuxinge/power-bi-project/tree/7951ba8b08ebd53cc6110cbf56d89e5a60e0a86c/Connecting%20and%20shaping%20the%20data)
  2. Building a relational model
  3. Adding calculated fields with Data Analysis Expressions (DAX)
  4. Designing an interactive dashboard
